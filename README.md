# Hospitalization-Prediction
This is my third project
It is made to predict whether a person will be hospitalized or not
It uses: - person's age, - gender, - the number of additional deseases, - the number of meds they have to consume, - the number of days a person spent being in a hospital, the number of recent appointment to the hospital, - the main desease.
If we take a look at the dataset we can see that those, who are older, who have a lot of additional deseases, numerous appointment, spent a lot of time in a hospital or they have a dangerous desease (like cancer or stroke), they are more likely to get hospitalized again
Note: The dataset does not represent the real-world data owing to being generated by AI for education purposes
